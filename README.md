# edit_nbhu_104-154

This is a simple data repo containing plain-text transcript files of four witnesses (P1, P2, V, E) and a Classical Text Editor (CTE) file for editing the Sanskrit text of NBhū 104–154. There is also a fifth transcript file (Cr) reflecting the simplified content of the CTE file. Finally, the CEX file combines all of the plain-text data for use with Brucheion.
